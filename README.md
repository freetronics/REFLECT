# Freetronics Reflect module
http://www.freetronics.com/products/dual-channel-i-r-reflectance-sensor

This sensor incorporates two QRE1113 infra-red reflectance sensors on a single PCB, spaced just the right distance apart to build a line following robot.

The PCB is symmetrical with snap-off holes across the middle, so you can either use it as a pair or snap it in half to have two separate reflectance sensors.
